# LuserBot

My first attempt at making an IRC chat bot in Elixir.  Horribly implemented and
probably breaks every single best practice in the Elixir/Erlang/OTP world.  But hey,
there's always a first time!

## Usage

Make sure you have Elixir, the latest version of 1.2.1 (at the moment) should suffice.

```
mix deps.get
mix run --no-halt
```
